# Flow-Edge-Detection

## Description
A graphics project to simulate lines flowing and forming user input images with simple per-pixel edge detection

## Here's how it works
### Choose your image
After cloning the repository, simply save any ".jpg" image you want inside "assets/" as "image.jpg". The example found by default in this repository is the famous painting: "Meisje met de parel". 
_Note that the edge detection in this project uses variance in color, this means that images with solid one colored backgrounds work better then colorful images_
